    <h2 class="sub-title">Description</h2>
    <p class="content">
      Manus is the final boss of the Artorias of the Abyss DLC. He is
      encountered in the Chasm of the Abyss. It is possible to summon the past
      version of Great Gray Wolf Sif to aid in the battle. Sif's summon sign is
      found in the arena where the player fights Manus, inside the fog door.
    </p>

    <h2 class="sub-title">Strategy</h2>
    <p class="content">
      It is possible for the player to kill Manus outside his fog gate: Kill all
      the surrounding Humanity Phantoms. Unequip all armor, then equip a fully
      upgraded longbow, Feather Arrows, the Symbol of Avarice, the Red Tearstone
      Ring, and the Hawk Ring. Unequip the Symbol of Avarice after the Red
      Tearstone Ring activates. Stand on the right side of the bridge that leads
      to the fog gate. There are a set of ridges, and on the third from the
      bridge, Manus's red eyes will be visible. Shoot towards the eyes until you
      successfully hit Manus. Keep shooting until his health is low. Now you
      have two options: Enter the fog door and finish him off. Kill him from the
      ledge. The fog gate will disappear and you'll gain his reward souls. When
      you approach the platform that Manus usually grabs you off of, you can
      roll off to land without damage. If the player wishes to face Manus
      conventionally, it is advisable to equip Stamina-boosting items that such
      as the Cloranthy Ring, as well as a high-Stability shield that blocks
      physical damage. Only attack Manus after he finishes his jumping smash or
      frenzy combo, lest you be caught in the middle of his strikes. Manus will
      start using his magic attacks at around 50% health. Use the Silver Pendant
      to deflect them, as they are difficult to dodge.
