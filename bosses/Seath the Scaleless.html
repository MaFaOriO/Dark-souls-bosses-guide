    <h2 class="sub-title">Description</h2>
    <p class="content">
      Seath is a descendant of the primordial archdragons who inhabited the
      world when, before the appearance of the First Flame, every element of the
      world was composed only of grey rocks. However, due to the "Disparity"
      that appeared following the ignition of the First Flame, Seath was born
      with unique characteristics compared to the original archdragons as he
      didn't possess the rock scales that made his peers immortal. In addition,
      Seath's pale and deformed body was infused with the magical power of
      moonlight that he managed to study, using this form of magic to create
      weapons that catalyzed it. Dukes archives The immense archives of Seath.
      At some point, the Four Lords who had found immense Lord Souls and built
      their civilizations underground, emerged to the surface with the intention
      of waging war against the Dragons and conquering the world for themselves.
      Seath thus decided to betray his race and abandon it to ally with Gwyn,
      Lord of Sunlight and help the Lords in their war, pillaging the Dragons of
      their sacred treasure: the "Primordial Crystal. After a long struggle Gwyn
      and the Lords eventually emerged victorious, exterminating most of the
      archdragons and conquering the surface world, thus beginning the Age of
      Fire defined by Gwyn's power and vision.

    <h2 class="sub-title">Strategy</h2>
    <p class="content">
      When first encountered in The Duke's Archives, he regenerates health
      extremely quickly due to the power of Primordial Crystal, effectively
      making him invincible.. He inevitably kills the player[note 1]. Loss of
      souls and humanity can be avoided by wearing a Ring of Sacrifice, but if
      he kills the player through Curse, then a Rare Ring of Sacrifice is needed
      to avoid penalties. In addition, it is possible to travel back through the
      fog door to avoid being killed by Seath, however can still go through the
      fog wall after exiting. Regardless, the player must be killed by Seath in
      order to progress. Upon encountering him again within the Crystal Cave, he
      will be fought within an arena that contains the Primordial Crystal. In
      order to defeat Seath, it is necessary to destroy the Primordial Crystal
      so that any damage dealt to him is not immediately healed. The crystal
      will respawn if the player dies or leaves the fight, making it necessary
      to destroy it in each attempt to defeat Seath. Staying at his side makes
      it easier to stay out of the area-of-effect of his breath attacks, and he
      won't be able to hit with his claws or tail as easily. Video It is also
      possible to use only a bow against Seath with great success. Get a good
      distance away from him and it is possible to get 4-5 shots in before he
      gets too close. The only real danger in this strategy is when running past
      Seath to gain some distance. His only long range specific attack is the
      far curse beam. That means if players stay at a distance, one can lure him
      to fire the beam and charge his defenseless body. Crystal curse explosion
      triggers when the player cannot be reached by any of Seath's other
      attacks; usually when situated behind Seath with the tails just out of
      reach. One strategy is to begin sprinting a good distance away from him
      once he arches forward to charge a ball of magic. A second approach would
      be to develop a high enough curse resistance and block some of the
      erupting crystals. Immediately heal the damage received before he executes
      his tail swipes/slams. Being the grandfather of Sorcery, Seath is
      extremely resistant to Magic damage, so it would be wise to try to use a
      different element when combating him. When trying to obtain the Moonlight
      Greatsword it is best to attack the tip of the tail, as the area around
      midway through the tail is considered his body. Thus dealing damage to
      this area will not help in acquiring the Moonlight Greatsword. A good
      strategy for acquiring it is when Seath himself breaks the Primordial
      Crystal. Wait behind the crystal until Seath starts to rear up his head
      for any of the Curse Beam attacks. Just before he fires it, start
      sprinting left or right around the sides and towards his tail. Seath will
      break the crystal and stun himself, giving the player ample opportunity to
      attack his tail three to four times. Make sure Seath's tail isn't clipping
      in the wall before trying. It should be noted that Seath takes extra
      damage if hit in his belly. As an example, when hit with standard 1H fast
      attack Man-serpent Greatsword +15 in of his tentacles at STR 40, Seath
      takes 226 damage. And if hit in his belly by the same attack, he will take
      about 450 damage. If the character is tanky enough and has enough Curse
      resistance, he can stay right at Seath's belly and hit him without pausing
      until Seath dies, using his Estus Flask only one or two times.
