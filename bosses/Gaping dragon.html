    <h2 class="sub-title">Description</h2>
    <p class="content">
      The Gaping Dragon has developed an additional pair of legs to support its
      large stomach, and even though it cannot fly, its four mangled wings are
      used to assist in high jumps. Its ravenous gluttony has transformed its
      rib cage into a gigantic vertical maw that can inflict crushing bites and
      oozes acid, while its head regressed to a stubby proboscis to detect
      potential prey.
    </p>

    <h2 class="sub-title">Strategy</h2>
    <p class="content">
      Being a Dragon, it is very susceptible to Lightning. Staying at the Gaping
      Dragon's side and attacking its legs, moving only when it begins to walk
      or fly, can result in an easy victory. Ranged attacks can prove useful,
      especially while the boss is performing a forward charge. Be sure to kill
      the Channeler located on the highest floor above the arena to prevent it
      from casting ranged attacks during the boss fight. It does not respawn. As
      long as care is taken with positioning, there is no need to block or dodge
      during the fight, making two-handed weapons an excellent choice for melee
      attacks. Locking on can make evading the Gaping Dragon's attacks harder,
      as it reduces the speed at which the player can move away from the boss.
      The Gaping Dragon will become momentarily still after its charge attack;
      this time can be used to attack it safely. The charge always comes after a
      stomach slam, so use the slam as a signal to get close to its side/tail.
      Hitting its head deals extra damage, but the head is only accessible right
      after a slam (and before a charge). More experienced players can shorten
      the fight considerably by hitting the head a couple of times right after
      the slam, and quickly getting out of the way before the charge starts. A
      hit to its head does approximately 3x as much damage as a hit to the body.
      Below 50% health, the dragon gains a new attack (corroding acid), that can
      reduce item and weapon durability, and even cause the player's equipment
      to break if stayed in too long. It's important not to confuse this attack
      with the stomach slam (their animations start in a similar way). The
      Gaping Dragon's tail can be cut off, rewarding the Dragon King Greataxe,
      and the tail swipe's range becomes extremely short, making the rest of the
      fight easier. If you are trying to get the axe, hit the middle (or end) of
      the tail; if you aim at the base of the tail (i.e., the "buttock" area)
      it's possible to kill the dragon before the tail itself has taken enough
      damage. A player phantom can offer ranged support and distract the Gaping
      Dragon from the balcony, if they don't enter the fog gate.
