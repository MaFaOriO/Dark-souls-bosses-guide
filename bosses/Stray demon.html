    <h2 class="sub-title">Description</h2>
    <p class="content">
      The Stray Demon wields an unidentified catalyst, a casting tool used to
      channel Magic. The weapon is possibly a Demon's Catalyst. The demon itself
      is similar in appearance to the Asylum Demon and the Demon Firesage. It
      has an almost draconic appearance, with green scales all over its body and
      a pair of stubby wings on its back. It sports a tail and horn-like growths
      portrude from its legs and arms. Dark red eyes are accompanied by a set of
      large teeth that are revealed by the demon's permanently exposed gums.

    <h2 class="sub-title">Strategy</h2>
    <p class="content">
      The player will first fall through the floor, lose some health from the
      landing, and end up across the room in front of the Stray Demon. Casting
      Fall Control before the fight will negate the damage players suffer from
      falling into the Stray Demon's pit. There is no place to use the White
      Sign Soapstone in this area so it is not possible to summon others for
      this fight. The major difference from the Asylum Demon is that the Stray
      Demon wields a catalyst-type weapon that is capable of creating large
      Magic explosions in front of it, inflicting serious damage in a wide area.
      The Stray Demon possesses two magic area-of-effect attacks, so learning
      the telegraphs for them is very important. When it prepares to wave its
      weapon horizontally, from left to right (player's right to left), it will
      create a large frontal magic explosion that can be very difficult to roll
      through. Its other area-of-effect attack is telegraphed by pointing its
      catalyst downward and planting it into the ground, which creates the
      self-centered explosion that can reach in an area behind it. The Crest
      Shield, dropped by Oscar of Astora, is highly useful in mitigating the
      magic damage. Ideally, much of the fight should be spent attacking the
      demon from behind, as this leaves it unable to hit the player with its
      weapon swings. However, caution should be exercised as its
      downward-stabbing magical explosion can still hit players standing next to
      its tail. Players can avoid this by retreating a few meters behind it when
      they see it lift the catalyst up in preparation. In between his explosion
      attacks, players should pelt his backside with their attack of choice. The
      Stray Demon will occasionally jump into the air and perform a rear-drop to
      reorient itself to face the player. When this occurs, this can be avoided
      by walking about two meters away. Using a shield will deal heavy stamina
      damage. Sticking to his right may damage and knockdown the player due to
      the weapon facing in that direction. The Stray Demon is susceptible to
      bleed damage and although it can be inflicted with both Toxic and Poison,
      it is immune to the damage of poison, though toxic will very slowly
      inflict damage. Like other demons, it also takes bonus damage from Black
      Knight weaponry. It is also not as susceptible to Black Firebombs as the
      Asylum Demon.
