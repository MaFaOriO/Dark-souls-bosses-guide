    <h2 class="sub-title">Description</h2>
    <p class="content">
      Gargoyles are stone creatures created by the Gods through magic to help
      patrol Anor Londo or sites deemed important. In addition to their though
      and hard skin, they are able to breathe fire or lightning and are armed
      with a bronze shield and a bronze helmet for purely decorative purposes
      while they use a bronze halbert as a weapon.
    </p>

    <h2 class="sub-title">Strategy</h2>
    <p class="content">
      As a human, it is possible to have Solaire of Astora and/or Knight Lautrec
      of Carim assist during this battle, although Lautrec must be freed and
      spoken to in Firelink Shrine first. Their summon signs are found just
      before the white light leading to the Gargoyles. Summoning both knights
      and simply mobbing each Gargoyle can lead to a quick and relatively
      painless victory. The fight begins with the constant danger of falling off
      (target-locking, coupled with the camera angle and narrow field of view,
      can make it hard to see where the main character's feet are) and facing
      off against a single gargoyle on top of the church roof. Trying to circle
      the gargoyle while holding up a shield is a good way to avoid its
      long-reaching frontal attacks. If the gargoyle takes off, move away or get
      ready to dodge its plunging attack. Once the first gargoyle is cut down to
      half its health, the second gargoyle will join the fight. Fortunately,
      this gargoyle is already severely injured (it arrives at half-health). It
      has the same attacks as the first gargoyle minus the ones that involve
      flying or using the tail. Players having difficulty managing their
      positioning against the two gargoyles should save any consumables (ex.,
      Fire Bombs) until the first gargoyle's health is approaching 50%, and then
      use them to finish it off quickly, before the second one starts attacking.
      The use of Gold Pine Resin and other weapon enhancements can also make
      this fight easier. Both Gargoyles wield halberds and can breathe fire,
      although the first gargoyle usually will only breathe fire after the
      second one jumps down. A fire-resistant shield such as the Black Knight
      Shield (and, optionally, fire-resistant armor) can be very useful, as the
      fire breath covers a wide area. While breathing fire, the gargoyles won't
      move, making it the perfect opportunity to run over and hit them from
      behind (this makes avoiding or blocking the fire doubly important, as its
      stagger effect will consume precious seconds, limiting the time available
      to attack the gargoyles). In addition, the first gargoyle's tail can be
      severed to gain a weapon (Gargoyle Tail Axe). The two Gargoyles fought in
      Anor Londo breathe lightning rather than fire, so a lightning-resistant
      shield will prove beneficial. A strategy for the second gargoyle is for
      the player to run to the bottom of the rotating staircase before
      activating the lever, where the gargoyle (on a ledge above) will be unable
      to reach them. However, this means it must then be defeated with ranged
      attacks.
