    <h2 class="sub-title">Description</h2>
    <p class="content">
      Izalith appears as a towering humanoid, visibly taller than both her
      children and their catalysts. She has blue lips, ashen skin and hands
      burnt from extracting her soul from the First Flame. She wears a much more
      refined version of the gold-hemmed black robes her children wear.

    <h2 class="sub-title">Strategy</h2>
    <p class="content">
      Unlike most boss encounters, the goal here is not to whittle away the
      boss's health, but to strike at three vulnerable nodes - two roots within
      glowing spheres, visible to the right and left of the boss at the start of
      the encounter, and the Chaos Bug within this boss' heart. Striking the
      roots expands the boss' list of available attacks and 'unlocks' access to
      the boss' heart. It is also noteworthy that progress made in damaging one
      or both of the roots does not reset upon the player's death, allowing
      repeated attempts at the boss to add incremental progress to the
      encounter. The greatest concerns to the player over the encounter will be
      dealing with the boss' broad, sweeping attacks and the large, bottomless
      holes that open in different parts of the arena. Once both roots have been
      cut, the player must reach the boss' heart to access and kill the Chaos
      Bug, however it is important to be aware that directly in front of the
      boss is a large bottomless hole. The primary way across is a wide branch
      that runs from the boss toward where the encounter begins, just below the
      height of the floor. A relatively safe method of dealing with both attacks
      and holes is to hug the walls around the outside of the arena, on the
      ledges behind the holes and out of reach of the boss (though, not the
      Volcanic Chaos attack, see below). From here, the player may sprint and
      jump to cross the holes and reach the orbs if their weight is low enough,
      or attack the branches and roots from range with magic or a bow. Another
      common strategy is to summon one or two phantoms and position both next to
      each orb, with the host out of reach of the Bed of Chaos' arm sweeps, but
      in a direct line towards the entrance to the core. After both phantoms
      break the orbs, the host can then head to the entrance of its mouth and
      kill the boss. A simple solo strategy involves "corpse-running" to the fog
      door and then running to each orb and then to the Bed of Chaos itself.
      Some players prefer to stay hollowed so that humanity is not wasted, since
      many deaths may follow after the first orb breaks. Players with a high
      number of Humanities or souls may be interested in investing in some Rings
      of Sacrifice. The chaos scythe/fire pick(s) attacks will almost always
      miss unless the player stays in one spot for too long. Its bug-like core
      is immune to fire damage. It is possible to make the Bed of Chaos's arm
      push the player towards the branch that leads to the core. Magic Shield
      and Strong Magic Shield can be extremely useful against Bed of Chaos, as
      they can easily block both the scythe and swiping attack with a medium
      shield without breaking player's guard. This creates a relatively long
      opening and player can use the remaining Stamina to quickly run towards
      the heart/orb and deal the fatal blow. Lingering Dragoncrest Ring is
      recommended to counter the short duration of both spells. One last
      potential strategy involves the use of shields with high stability. By
      two-handing a shield such as Havel's Greatshield, and with sufficient
      Stamina, a player can become almost completely immune to both the damage
      and knockback effects of the Bed of Chaos's sweeping attacks.
