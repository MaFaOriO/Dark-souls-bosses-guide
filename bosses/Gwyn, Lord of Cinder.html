    <h2 class="sub-title">Description</h2>
    <p class="content">
      Lord Gwyn wears an impressive set of royal drapes, with gold bands on his
      arms, and a crown atop his head. On his feet are what appear to be a form
      of moccasins and anklets, and he wields a greatsword imbued with the power
      of light and of the First Flame, which he uses to adequate effect. His
      face is that of an aged man with calm eyes, and he has an impressively
      long, grey beard and hair of the same nature. When the Chosen Undead
      fights Gwyn in the Kiln of the First Flame, Gwyn Is nothing more than an
      empty husk with an haggard appearance, charred skin and hollowed eyes.

    <h2 class="sub-title">Strategy</h2>
    <p class="content">
      Health and Stamina management are a must in this fight, as Gwyn will
      rarely give the player any chances to heal. It is heavily advisable to use
      a fast weapon to attack with, preferably one that drains little stamina.
      Heavy weapons are not recommended for this fight. It may be hard for the
      player to find a proper opening to fight back or heal as a result of Gwyn
      actively seeking the player. Despite his very weakened state, he is still
      the former Lord of Sunlight, so don't rely on lightning as he is immune.
      His attacks deal a great amount of damage if they connect. If blocked, his
      attacks will still deal considerable damage to the player as a result of
      the flame damage his sword deals. A good way to reduce the damage to a
      slight margin is by using shields with high fire defense, such as the
      Black Iron Greatshield or the Black Knight Shield, which can be dropped by
      the nearby Black Knights; however, care should still be taken as blocking
      a full attack chain will cost a lot of stamina and may eventually result
      in losing health or dying. The Gold-Hemmed Black Set can further negate
      the fire damage at the cost of less physical defense against his attacks.
      The pillars in the arena can be used to block his attacks, however, Gwyn
      will easily move around them and continue attacking. It is possible for
      him to keep attacking a pillar that is blocking his path, giving the
      player a chance to heal, however, he may simply go around it. Parrying is
      a high-risk, but incredibly efficient strategy. All of Gwyn's attacks,
      minus the kick and grab, can be parried. Using the Hornet Ring, a single
      riposte can erase a large fraction of Gwyn's health. However, any mistakes
      can end up badly for the player. Therefore, it may be preferable to opt
      for heavier armor for this strategy, as dodging is not the main tactic,
      and the additional poise and defense leaves some margin for error. It is
      ideal to block the first hit of his combo, and parry the telegraphed
      second hit. After performing a riposte, the player will have just enough
      time to Estus heal. Summoning Solaire or other players can help ease the
      battle, giving a chance to heal or apply buffs. For Solaire, he may be
      able to land several hits before dying. By using the Black Knight Halberd
      or a spear type weapon you can hit Gwyn through the pillars and take
      little damage from his attacks. While Gwyn does not provide for a lot of
      openings, especially if wielding a slow weapon like the Zweihander, it is
      possible, through using a shield with enough stability and having enough
      fire resistance, to use a circling strategy. Keeping very close to Gwyn
      and keeping a shield up, the player can be dealt very little damage by the
      flaming sword by constantly strafing to the player's left. When Gwyn
      attempts to grab the player or kick them, the slower animation should
      enable the player to get behind Gwyn's back, thus making the attack miss.
      At that point, there's a small window to get an attack in. With a weapon
      with a strong enough attack to break Gwyn's poise, the player then has a
      full second to finish the attack animation and get the shield back up,
      effectively never breaking their guard. Use of this strategy requires the
      player to keep a close look on their stamina bar. Regularly, though, the
      player will have to heal themselves, unless the fire damage is completely
      negated. Using the pillar strategy outlined above is quite efficient. It
      is a good idea to keep one's health high enough to that a grab attack
      can't kill with one hit. Therefore, having 20 estus flasks is recommended.
