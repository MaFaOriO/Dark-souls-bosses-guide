    <h2 class="sub-title">Description</h2>
    <p class="content">
      Priscilla is a humanoid half-dragon roughly five meters tall. Her skin is
      extremely pale, her hair is stark white and she has a patch of fur beneath
      her hairline resembling an exaggerated widow's peak. This fur is framed by
      a row of small white spikes just above her brows. She has a fluffy white
      articulate tail with draconic proportions that emerges between two layers
      of her gown, which is of the same furry texture. She is capable of turning
      invisible and walks barefoot despite the snowy terrain. She speaks very
      softly, and attempts diplomacy with those who invade her world but
      prominently carries a large scythe capable of absorbing the life of her
      opponents for self-defense.

    <h2 class="sub-title">Strategy</h2>
    <p class="content">
      It is wise to move into position prior to starting, since she is initially
      neutral. If Priscilla's Dagger is desired, it is recommended to go for her
      tail first, as there will be an opportunity to get a few free hits in
      before she attacks. She will become invisible as soon as she is attacked.
      When she is invisible, the most reliable way to determine her location is
      to watch for the large footprints that she leaves behind in the snow. Care
      should be taken, since approximately half of the staging area is not
      covered in snow. She will turn visible again when her Poise is broken. If
      Priscilla is hit with any Pyromancies or fire dealing weapons, she will
      re-appear more quickly. Also, if the player successfully hits her with an
      arrow or a Throwing Knife, they will stick to her body for a while,
      revealing her position. Priscilla's attacks can inflict Bleed at an
      alarming rate. It is advisable to equip items that reduce bleeding status
      and have plenty of Bloodred Moss Clumps ready. The Bloodbite Ring is
      especially effective for reducing any Bleed buildup inflicted upon damage.
      Players should re-position themselves when Crossbreed Priscilla strafes
      the player in an attempt to flank them. Players or summons that have
      aggroed Crossbreed Priscilla and turn their back on her while trying to
      gain some distance can get easily stun-locked by her combo attacks and
      will certainly die if the Bleed meter is filled. Once you initiate the
      fight, if you lock on while she's turning invisible, your targeting
      reticle will briefly follow her when she jumps away from the spot she
      turns invisible. This can grant you an opportunity to turn her visible
      quickly, provided you can stagger her in one shot (such as with a powerful
      Great Combustion). A common problem players have while looking to cut off
      Priscilla's tail is that they may already be too strong, her before they
      can break her poise. A simple workaround consists in attacking her with
      arrows. After about three or four successful hits, Priscilla will turn
      visible again. Additionally, those arrows that have connected will stick
      to her body, giving away her position and making it easier to connect more
      hits. An alternate method consists in using the Dragonslayer Greatbow,
      which guarantees staggering Priscilla and turn her visible with just one
      hit, even if the player doesn't have the required stats to wield the
      weapon properly.
