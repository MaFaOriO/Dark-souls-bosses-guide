    <h2 class="sub-title">Description</h2>
    <p class="content">
      The Centipede Demon wields no weapon and instead uses its heads to fight.
      Prior to awakening, the demon rests motionless on a rock face. When
      awakened, flames ignite out of the four spikes on its back and the
      multiple sets of eyes open aglow, then it drops down on two reptilian
      feet. The creature has a total of six demonic centipede heads: two on its
      back, two as arms, and the last two as the head and tail. The heads can
      extend, spit fireballs, and be cut off. The right "arm" is the biggest
      head and has the longest range. The left one is used to grab opponents and
      put them in its toothed chest. Its powerful legs let it jump tremendously
      high.

    <h2 class="sub-title">Strategy</h2>
    <p class="content">
      The Centipede Demon is susceptible to both magic and lightning damage, but
      is immune to fire. It is possible to skip this boss by being Rank 2 or
      higher in the Chaos Servant covenant to open the shortcut to Lost Izalith.
      If the player does not use the shortcut, the Orange Charred Ring it drops
      is vital to get through Lost Izalith. Players can sever the Centipede
      Demon's tail or arm up to 5 times, as they slowly regenerate during the
      battle. Its severed limbs become enemies that chase the player. The first
      severed limb rewards the player with the Orange Charred Ring early,
      instead of at the end of the battle. Subsequent severed limbs offer no
      reward, but temporally reduce the range of the demon's attacks. The player
      can summon Solaire of Astora to help. His summon sign is located just
      before the demon's Fog Gate. Solaire can help distract the boss but tends
      to suffer heavy damage despite having his own Orange Charred Ring, due to
      often engaging the demon while it's still in lava. It is possible to have
      a relatively safe fight with high endurance, defense and fire defense.
      After several extending pounces, the demon will usually perform a wind-up
      smash and then get very close to fog door. Staying between the monster's
      legs will force it to do high jumps and exploding jumps. The demon will
      also try to consume the player sometimes, but staying close to its legs
      after it lands and blocking while the demon is in the air is a good way to
      stay alive and land successive shots to the knee. Explosive jumps are
      still dangerous, though. A useful strategy for the Centipede Demon is to
      sever its right head, spawning the head as a separate enemy. Upon killing
      the head, the player will acquire the Orange Charred Ring. The player can
      then exit the arena with a Homeward Bone or quitting, then reenter with
      the ring equipped. Doing so allows access to the whole boss arena, letting
      them charge the demon while taking only minor lava damage. This lets the
      player have more room to maneuver.
