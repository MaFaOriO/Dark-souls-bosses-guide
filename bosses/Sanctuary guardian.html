    <h2 class="sub-title">Description</h2>
    <p class="content">
      Being a hybrid of different creatures, the Sanctuary Guardian possesses
      various abilities. Its body is part lion, part goat, and has a long,
      spiked scorpion tail, in addition to two sets of wings. Its red-eyed lion
      half has white fur and large paws, which it uses to strike its opponent.
      Its goat legs have a dark purple color and can perform powerful kicks, and
      it uses its large set of curved horns to ram its opponent. Its four large
      wings give it the ability to fly for short periods of time and to release
      powerful blasts of wind, and its scorpion tail has poisonous properties.
      In addition to these deadly abilities, the beast can spew lightning
      projectiles from its mouth.

    <h2 class="sub-title">Strategy</h2>
    <p class="content">
      The Sanctuary Guardian has a high lightning and magic resistance, as well
      as a medium fire resistance, but is weaker to physical attacks. The fight
      is primarily made up of fast physical combos, lightning projectiles thrown
      in as environmental hazards, and poisonous attacks. Most attacks can be
      dodged by rolling, but large stamina depletion will occur if blocking is
      preferred. The Sanctuary Guardian can easily stunlock and kill low Poise
      players with its four hit combos. Low Stamina or over-encumbered players
      may have a tough time enduring hit after hit. This boss can be bled, but
      up to four successive hits must land. It can be tricky to sever its tail,
      as only two of its attacks bring its tail within easy reach (Head Charge
      and Swoop). Should players decide to equip a shield to fight the Sanctuary
      Guardian, the Eagle Shield is particularly well suited for this battle: it
      combines 95% physical protection (100% before patch 1.06) and 75%
      lightning protection, with great stability, all for a moderate weight and
      low Strength requirement. It is ill-advised to take on this battle with
      slow roll: Indeed, the slow roll will not take the player far enough to
      dodge the "Wave of Water" attack, which otherwise leaves it wide open for
      a counterattack. If the player cannot dodge then it is better to stagger
      for a short time than to block this attack as blocking drains large
      amounts of stamina and will leave the player vulnerable to the Sanctuary
      Guardian's follow-up charge attack, while absorbing the blow will not
      damage the player and leaves time to block or roll afterwards.
