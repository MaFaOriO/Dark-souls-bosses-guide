    <h2 class="sub-title">Description</h2>
    <p class="content">
      Quelaag is a daughter of the Witch of Izalith and, along with most of her
      family, failed to escape from the chaotic flame and was corrupted by it.
      Due to exposure to the flame, Quelaag and her sister mutated into
      spider-like creatures with their upper body being fused to the monsters'
      backs.
    </p>

    <h2 class="sub-title">Strategy</h2>
    <p class="content">
      A relatively easy way to beat this boss is to be human and summon Maneater
      Mildred, whose summon sign is right outside the Fog Door. Let Mildred
      distract Quelaag and stay away from her lava attack, as this is certain
      death. When away from her, pick off her health with ranged attacks, while
      Mildred tanks. This way Quelaag should be dead within a short period of
      time. Another easy way to kill her is to get any halberd with a vertical
      light attack, such as the Great Scythe or Gargoyle's Halberd, and then
      repeatedly hitting Quelaag's human part. When aimed properly, she will
      stagger every time the attack connects, interupting whatever she's doing.
      This can be repeated to prevent her from attacking at all. There is a spot
      between the stairs on the far side of the arena and the wall where Quelaag
      is unable to reach the player, at which point she can safely be killed
      from a distance using ranged attacks.
