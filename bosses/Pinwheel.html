    <h2 class="sub-title">Description</h2>
    <p class="content">
      Pinwheel is a necromancer wearing three masks of those that compose them:
      the Father's, Mother's and the Child's mask. Their body looks swollen and
      has three pairs of "arms", hinting that they are composed of three bodies
      or skeletons fused together.
    </p>

    <h2 class="sub-title">Strategy</h2>
    <p class="content">
      Pinwheel is a very frail boss, with the fifth lowest hit points of any
      boss in the game.[8] However, he can quickly become dangerous as he can
      summon an unlimited number of clones, all of whom deal the same amount of
      damage as he does. Therefore, a good strategy for fighting Pinwheel is to
      rush at him right when the fight starts and do as much damage as possible.
      When he teleports after summoning his clones, it is still possible to land
      some hits on him before he disappears. A simple tactic to identify the
      clones from the real Pinwheel is to lock on to him when possible.
      Pinwheel's high fire damage can be greatly reduced through the use of
      Flash Sweat and shields with high fire resistance like the Black Knight
      Shield or Dragon Crest Shield. However, caution is advised as taking
      multiple hits at once will still deal a large amount of damage to the
      player, especially if they are trying to block while surrounded.
