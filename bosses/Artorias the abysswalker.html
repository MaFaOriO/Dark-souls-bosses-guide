    <h2 class="sub-title">Description</h2>
    <p class="content">
      By the time the Chosen Undead encounters him, Artorias is shown to have
      already been corrupted by the Abyss with his armor looking putrefied,
      oozing an aura of darkness. His crippled arm is likely the result of
      Artorias halting the spread from devouring his wolf companion by means of
      a now missing shield. He possesses a greatsword that has also been
      consumed, yet is still far from ineffective. Having lost his sanity, the
      knight moves about in an untamed, beastly manner as he howls beneath the
      blue shroud of his helm.
    </p>

    <h2 class="sub-title">Strategy</h2>
    <p class="content">
      While this boss is rather difficult to predict, he does have a few signs
      for his attacks, and well-timed rolls prove useful here. Being able to
      fast-roll is highly advised but not necessary. The player can place
      themself away from him by about twice his reach at all times, even for
      melee.
