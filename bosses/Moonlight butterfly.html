    <h2 class="sub-title">Description</h2>
    <p class="content">
      A very large butterfly that has no visible head or legs and shows a
      wheel-like device between its upper wings. Moonlight Butterflies are
      capable of firing various magic attacks, but they don't have any melee
      capabilities. The Butterfly in the Darkroot Forest is a boss and attacks
      as soon as its room is entered, but those found in the Crystal Cave are
      passive and will not attack the player unless provoked.

    <h2 class="sub-title">Strategy</h2>
    <p class="content">
      It is possible to summon Witch Beatrice in the destructible shrubs
      underneath the stairs, just before the boss (as long as the player has
      reversed hollowing). Her magic attacks, despite some accuracy issues, do
      colossal damage to the boss, making it possible for Beatrice to kill the
      butterfly by herself before the player even has a chance to attack it
      themselves. The Moonlight Butterfly's attacks are magic based. Wear light
      armor with high magic resistance (physical resistance is irrelevant), so
      you can dodge quickly and mitigate damage in case you get hit. The
      butterfly spends most of the fight outside of melee range. While it's
      possible to defeat it using only melee weapons, players lacking ranged
      attacks (i.e., a bow or magic) are left to dodge (or block and heal) until
      it lands. A ranged weapon is therefore strongly advised, but not one that
      locks the player into long charge / reload animations (i.e., don't try to
      use a Heavy Crossbow), which would make it much harder to dodge the
      projectiles. The priority during the flight phases is to stay alive (and,
      ideally, take no damage at all). During the flight phases, try to keep as
      far as possible (though within targeting range, naturally) to make it
      easier to identify and dodge the butterfly's attacks. All the attacks can
      be dodged, resulting in zero damage taken. As a general rule, dodge
      towards the projectiles (and through the laser beam) just as they're about
      to hit you, but away from the blue orb (Soul Sphere), before it gets too
      close to you. When the butterfly is on the fog gate's side of the bridge,
      you can use the gate itself to block its attacks. When the butterfly
      lands, switch to a melee weapon (preferably two-hand) and hit it for as
      much damage as possible (it won't fight back during this phase). Equipping
      the Grass Crest Shield will improve stamina regeneration and allow the
      player to get more hits in. For magic users, switch to a high-DPS spell
      such as Combustion or its improved versions. The Butterfly gradually
      restores lost Health when it lands, and although it isn't a significant
      amount, one should still make sure to deal as much damage as possible to
      avoid extending the battle. If you prefer to stay at range with a bow when
      the butterfly lands, keep in mind that locking onto the butterfly's center
      will probably cause projectiles to hit the wall without causing damage.
      One can continue to shoot the butterfly's wings manually by disengaging
      the lock-on, and since the butterfly's only attack in this phase is
      close-range, the player can keep firing with impunity until it takes off
      again. A few seconds after landing, it will glow and emit noise, just
      before releasing a large area-of-effect attack. Move out of range before
      the attack goes off to avoid significant damage. Switch back to your
      ranged weapons / spells, and repeat until the boss is dead.
