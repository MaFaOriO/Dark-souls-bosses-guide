    <p class="content">
      Gwyndolin initiates players into the Blade of the Darkmoon covenant. He
      accepts Souvenirs of Reprisal in exchange for increasing the player's rank
      in the covenant.

    <h2 class="sub-title">Strategy</h2>
    <p class="content">
      Gwyndolin's boss battle takes place in a seemingly never-ending corridor.
      He is not a very difficult boss if the player has decent dodging skills.
      Of his three attacks, two can be avoided by hiding behind pillars, while
      the last one is more powerful and fast (he will tend to use the Sphere
      Shot after Orb Spread if the player is hiding behind pillars). The main
      issue in this fight is reaching him, as he will teleport away when the
      player approaches (equipping the Ring of Fog may increase the time
      available to attack before he teleports), meaning that the best time to
      run up to him is when he is just finishing off his Arrow Spread, as he
      takes a few moments to recover. Gwyndolin can still be damaged while he is
      in his teleporting animation and for a split second after actually moving,
      so it is possible to deal considerable damage at that moment.
      56f309da8ec03745e693db347499f26265f56c1b hq Both the Orb and Arrow Spread
      attacks are avoidable by hiding behind one of the pillars on either side
      of the corridor. The Sphere Shot, on the other hand, will go through
      walls, inflicting full damage if not blocked or avoided. The Orb Spread
      and Sphere Shot are Magic-based, though, so a shield that can block 100%
      physical damage and has good Magic resistance, like the Crest Shield, is
      recommended for this fight. While devastating, both the Sphere Shot and
      Arrow Spread attacks have no tracking whatsoever and are easily avoided
      simply by running diagonally. If a player does not want to risk it too
      much, a good strategy to catch up to him is by moving from pillar to
      pillar until they are about two pillars away from Gwyndolin and then wait
      until he shoots his Arrow Spread. This attack can consist of two-to-four
      arrow barrages. Wait until he finishes the second one and go for him, if
      he shoots any subsequent arrows, dodge them by running diagonally.
      Alternatively, once Gwyndolin teleports the first time upon entering the
      tomb, it is possible to move closer to him to a point just outside his
      aggro range; then, by equipping the Hawk Ring and using the Dragonslayer
      Greatbow, the player can easily defeat him from range without him
      retaliating.
