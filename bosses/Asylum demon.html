    <h2 class="sub-title">Description</h2>
    <p class="content">
      The Asylum Demon wields a Demon's Great Hammer, an intimidating weapon
      molded from stone archtrees. The demon has an almost draconic appearance,
      with spotted blue-green scales all over its body and a pair of stubby
      wings on its back. It sports a tail and horn-like growths portrude from
      its legs and arms. Dark red eyes are accompanied by a set of large teeth
      that are revealed by the demon's permanently exposed gums.
    </p>

    <h2 class="sub-title">Strategy</h2>
    <p class="content">
      The first encounter with the Asylum Demon is optional and it is highly
      advised for first-time players to escape the room to avoid confrontation.
      However, if the player has obtained Black Firebombs as a starting gift,
      they can be used to defeat the demon relatively quickly, requiring just 5
      of them (in NG). Killing the Asylum Demon within this first encounter will
      yield the Demon's Great Hammer. Should the player avoid the first
      encounter, they will have to endure the mandatory second encounter with
      the Asylum Demon. However, the player can gain a massive advantage by
      using a plunging attack from the ledge above the boss. This will typically
      deal 1/4 of its health bar, varying depending on which weapon is used.
      Take note that wielding one's weapon two-handed is recommended for the
      plunging attack, as it will increase the damage of the attack.
      Furthermore, players should not stand upon the platform for too long
      because the demon will eventually leap up and destroy the platform,
      potentially killing the player. On New Game Plus, the Asylum Demon can be
      easily defeated in the first encounter as the player retains all of their
      equipment from their previous playthrough.
    </p>

    <h2 class="sub-title">Drop</h2>
    <p class="content">
      Defeating the Asylum Demon before picking up the player's class weapon
      will grant a <b>Demon's Great Hammer</b>. The <b>Big Pilgrim's Key</b> the
      Asylum Demon would drop otherwise is given by Oscar in this case.
