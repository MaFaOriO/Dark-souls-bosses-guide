    <h2 class="sub-title">Description</h2>
    <p class="content">
      Capra Demons wield two Demon Great Machetes, hooked Ultra Greatswords that
      are made from cast iron. The demons themselves are large humanoids with
      four red-glowing eyes and a horned skull for a head. They each possess a
      bone tail, and have exposed shoulder blades and spines. They also wear a
      ragged skirt made of straw.

    <h2 class="sub-title">Strategy</h2>
    <p class="content">
      The boss version of the Capra Demon battles the player in a small,
      confined room which makes it harder to recuperate health and stamina. It
      is best for the player to eliminate the two Attack Dogs as quickly as
      possible as they may stun-lock low Poise players and can also trap players
      in a corner. Climbing the staircase will enable the player to attack the
      boss with ranged weapons and give them an opportunity to recover; however,
      the boss can still reach the player. Players can climb the set of stairs
      and walk onto the protruding archway over the door at the far end of the
      room to recover safely. The Capra Demon will climb the stairs after you,
      but will be blocked by the low railing and miss its swings as long as the
      player is standing on the far end of the arch. Should the player have
      sorceries or pyromancy available to them, they can remain on the archway
      and batter the Capra Demon from out of its range, moving to the very
      corner of the archway to avoid being hit by its leap attack after it
      climbs the stairs. The Capra Demon has a long recovery time every time it
      lands after jumping, so if one lures it up the stairs and baits it into
      jumping off, the player can use that opportunity to deal decent amounts of
      damage. The Capra Demon is weak to fire, so Charcoal Pine Resins and
      Firebombs can be effective. Wearing armor with high physical protection
      and poise will prove very useful against Capra Demon as all of its damage
      is physical. Weapons with high damage that aren't slow are also useful, as
      the fight revolves around mobility. If the weapon also has high Poise
      damage, this will help in stunning the Capra Demon out of attacks. High
      stability shields will be helpful in blocking a majority of its attacks.
      An easy way to defeat the Capra Demon consists in equipping the Ring of
      Fog before traversing the fog gate, this way the Attack Dogs will ignore
      the player completely and the boss can be fought without intrusions, as
      long as the battle is kept near the archway.
