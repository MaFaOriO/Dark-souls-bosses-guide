    <h2 class="sub-title">Description</h2>
    <p class="content">
      Nito's body is that of an immensely sized human skeleton, though the
      ribcage is packed with bits of dead matter, and blown open as a result.
      The torso leans forwards as well, giving him a hunchback appearance, and
      his true skull is tucked into the dead matter and bones. His left leg is
      built like those on a dog or other four legged creature, while his right
      leg is humanlike, giving him a sort of handicap and reducing his movement
      to a slow limp. The other skeletons merely adorn him as armor, with his
      entire torso covered in ribcages and skulls, and arms and legs dangling
      all around him. What was once an all concealing cloak looking like black
      fur or feather, apparently conjured at will, is reduced to a tattered
      hairlike cloak. When dormant, Nito did not seem to wear it until after
      generating a glowing fume of lavender white power, likely the "miasma of
      death" he is known for. His left hand is natural, his right is equipped
      with a triple bone forearm, which terminates in a sharpened bone blade
      covered with his miasma.

    <h2 class="sub-title">Strategy</h2>
    <p class="content">
      When falling into Nito's domain, some damage will be incurred. This can be
      negated through use of the Fall Control sorcery. If Fall Control is
      unavailable, make sure to heal once landed, preferably with Estus as the
      other forms might not be fast enough to avoid Nito's ranged attack. Nito
      is a very large, very slow boss with average HP. This makes large weapons
      and slow spells excellent candidates for dealing damage to him quickly.
      Nito's attacks often cause toxin and can be quite damaging, but almost all
      of them have a very long startup time and are easily avoidable. All of the
      attacks except the sword dance can be blocked. Nito is aided by some minor
      Skeletons initially, and Giant Skeletons if the player ventures too far
      from the place they fell down from. Both types of Skeletons resurrect
      after being killed, unless they are killed with a Divine weapon (even with
      a Divine weapon a Phantom can't kill the skeletons, only the Host can).
      They are no tougher than the Skeletons found throughout The Catacombs and
      the Tomb of the Giants, but may prove to be a fatal distraction to
      fighting Nito himself. Because Nito is so slow, it is a good idea to kill
      all of his minions with a Divine weapon before engaging with him, so the
      skeletons will not get in the way. As long as you are not close to him,
      the only attack you have to watch out for is his Gravelord Greatsword
      (listen for the scream and start running). Wearing the Slumbering
      Dragoncrest Ring will help in avoiding confrontation with the Giant
      Skeletons at the back of the cavern. He can easily be strafed behind for
      free hits, resulting in large amounts of damage especially if attacking
      him with fire weapons or pyromancies (as he is weak to fire).
