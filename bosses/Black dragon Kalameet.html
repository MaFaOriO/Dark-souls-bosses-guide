    <h2 class="sub-title">Description</h2>
    <p class="content">
      Kalameet is a descendant of the primordial archdragons. Due to the
      "Disparity" that appeared following the ignition of the First Flame,
      Kalameet was born with unique characteristics compared to the original
      archdragons as he possessed a single orange eye, the ability to produce a
      high frequency noise which doubles the damage received by targets hit by
      this attack and an obsidian hide that makes him not only able to resist
      magic and fire like other dragons but even lightning which was their weak
      point.
    </p>

    <h2 class="sub-title">Strategy</h2>
    <p class="content">
      One of the most important things to note about Black Dragon Kalameet is
      that his "fire breath" is actually dark sorcery-based. It deals both magic
      and physical damage and deals high stability damage. As such, instead of
      fire defense, players should increase their physical and magic defense.
      Blocking Kalameet's fire breath is ill-advised: the magic damage will
      strike through the shield, damaging the player. Weaker shields will cause
      the player to have their guard broken, taking more damage than what the
      player would have initially taken. Only greatshields should be used to
      block Kalameet's fire breath and only Havel's Greatshield can reliably
      block it. Other options include the Cleansing Greatshield and the Stone
      Greatshield, but these can sometimes have their guard broken if the player
      is not careful in managing their stamina. Kalameet is resistant to all
      elements including being resistant to lightning damage (Lightning damage
      is supposed be effective against dragons but this is not the case,
      probably because of his peculiar body, so it is best to avoid lightning
      weapons as well as offensive miracles such as Lightning Spear). Therefore,
      it is recommended that players use purely physical weapons. With the
      proper timing, all of Kalameet's attacks can be avoided with fast rolling.
      Strafing to Kalameet's left is generally safest, as it is harder for his
      often-used Head Strike to hit the player.
