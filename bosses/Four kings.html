    <h2 class="sub-title">Description</h2>
    <p class="content">
      The Four Kings are humans several meters tall with profoundly changed
      bodies and completely gray skin. Bark-like wooden membranes spread out
      chaotically from their heart, where their Dark Sign once stood, almost
      entirely covering their chest and left arm and spreading like branches.
      Several root-like horns extend from their heads and their spindly legs
      appear to be covered in bark. They all wield an enormous but terribly
      distorted and segmented sword, similar to the roots of their body.

    <h2 class="sub-title">Strategy</h2>
    <p class="content">
      Unequipping the Covenant of Artorias will result in the player dying
      immediately; you cannot unequip this ring while fighting the Four Kings.
      After the battle has been completed, the ring is no longer necessary and
      may be unequipped without dying. Upon entry, the player will have time to
      cast any sort of buffs, during which a single king will appear; the second
      will join approximately one minute later; the last two appearing in the
      minute following. It is vital to eliminate each King quickly to avoid
      being surrounded. There is no obligation to kill any specific amount of
      kings, so it is possible to spread out the damage to several of them. This
      can be done by dealing massive postmortem damage to a single King, as they
      can still be hurt during their death animation. Power Within adds decent
      amounts of damage to attacks and can help destroy individual Kings quickly
      before the next one appears. The use of Great Magic Barrier, Magic
      Barrier, or any equipment with high magic resistance can help, as all of
      their attacks deal at least partial magic damage. The damage dealt by the
      Kings in NG+ is far greater than in NG, so it may prove difficult to
      absorb their attacks with heavy armor. Staying close to a King will force
      the lower portion of the blade to hit, minimizing damage. This is true
      even on NG+, as getting hit by the upper section of their blade will deal
      heavy damage. This will also prevent it from using some magic attacks
      (namely, the homing shot) and the unengaged Kings tend to use melee at
      most distances. Using a ranged attack and staying at around 1-1.5 roll
      distance away in front of the king (just within the reach of his sword)
      makes him rely mostly on the vertical slashes and the occasional Homing
      Abyss Arrow or Life Drain. The Life Drain is also easier avoided since it
      looks less like Wrath of the Kings at this distance then it does close up,
      and the player already has a head start on getting out of reach. Their
      homing attacks can be deflected by using Force or Wrath of the Gods,
      although it is safer to avoid the attacks entirely. Due to the speed at
      which the King approaches, the player will become vulnerable to other
      attacks during the casting animation. Deflecting the large homing shot
      will likely be fatal, since the duration of the attack lasts a fair while
      and doesn't collide with anything other than the player. Initially, it can
      be hard to determine how close a king is; they can appear close, when they
      are in fact out of reach. It's a good idea to run into a king before
      attacking, not only to be sure your attacks will land, but also because
      being close to a king can cause his attacks to miss. Using armor with good
      poise (Havel's Set will be the best for this as it has good defense
      without using materials) while staying close to the kings will allow you
      to tank through the hits (as they deal significantly less damage while you
      are next to them) and constantly hit them. Be wary, though, as full heavy
      armor is extremely heavy so fat rolling or even no rolling is likely.
      Using Green Blossoms and the Grass Crest Shield is also recommended.
