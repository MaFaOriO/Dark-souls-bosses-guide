    <h2 class="sub-title">Description</h2>
    <p class="content">
      Sif makes an appearance in the Artorias of The Abyss DLC. The player finds
      the wolf located behind an Illusory Wall after being led about by Alvina
      in the Chasm of the Abyss. Sif is found protected by a magical barrier,
      which was created by Artorias using his Greatshield in order to shield the
      wolf from the corruption of the Abyss. Upon reaching Sif after defeating
      the Humanity Phantoms, Sif will vanish and leave behind Artorias' shield.
      Sif can be summoned during the battle against Manus, Father of the Abyss,
      after being rescued by the player.
    </p>

    <h2 class="sub-title">Strategy</h2>
    <p class="content">
      For melee fighters, getting underneath Sif is generally the best strategy,
      as it makes most attacks miss the player character completely. Care must
      still be taken to dodge, block or move out of the way of the slam attack,
      though. Locking on is not always a good idea when doing this, as it can
      make the camera spin and make it harder to control one's position.
      Two-handing is more effective, as it will make the fight shorter and
      reduce the number of slams that need to be dodged. For ranged characters,
      players can simply target-lock Sif and kite Sif backwards around the edge
      of the arena. Staying as far as possible away from Sif will cause most, if
      not all, of Sif's attacks to miss. Using miracles, sorcery, or pyromancy
      to soften Sif up before moving in with melee attacks can also prove to be
      effective. Using a summoned phantom as a decoy can make positioning
      oneself under Sif easier. In a party of two or more players only one
      should try to get under Sif, otherwise players may bump into each other
      when trying to dodge Sif's attacks. Sif's attacks can be blocked, but most
      of them will cause a significant loss of stamina, even with a good shield.
      Learning Sif's attack patterns and avoiding them completely, either by
      dodging or simply walking out of the way, is highly recommended. Before
      the player enters through the fog gate, there is a broken piece of bridge
      to the left that can be jumped onto. This is most easily accomplished by
      unequipping all gear beforehand. After reaching the bridge there is
      another pile of rock resting at the top that can easily be reached through
      jumping. When at the top, Sif will be visible. Sif will be unable to reach
      the player, but the player will be able to damage Sif with arrows or other
      ranged attacks.
