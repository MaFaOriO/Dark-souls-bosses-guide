    <h2 class="sub-title">Description</h2>
    <p class="content">
      Taurus Demons wield Demon's Greataxes, weapons carved from the bones of
      fellow demons. They are large, minotaur-like monsters covered in brown
      fur. Alongside their yellow eyes, large horns protrude out of their
      skeletal heads and a tail hangs between their legs.
    </p>

    <h2 class="sub-title">Strategy</h2>
    <p class="content">
      A quick method to defeating the boss version of this creature is to climb
      the tower's ladder next to the entrance and perform a plunging attack from
      above. The player should eliminate the two Undead Soldiers guarding the
      tower before triggering the boss or they will get in the way. Caution is
      advised as the Taurus Demon can hurt the player while they are climbing if
      they are too slow. It can also jump up to the tower if the player stays up
      there for too long. This can be used to the player's advantage though, as
      it gives the player time to climb back down the ladder. Once the Taurus
      Demon climbs back down, a quick climb to the top and a few firebombs
      quickly dispatches the boss. While running back, the player can safely
      attack its legs to do additional damage. The player can also use Gold Pine
      Resin in conjunction with this strategy to increase damage. If the player
      decides to take this boss head on, the player can avoid all of its attacks
      by running between the demon's legs. It is also worth noting that the
      demon can accidentally fall off the side of the arena. This is more likely
      to happen when it is on the tower roof and when it performs a Jumping
      Pound.
