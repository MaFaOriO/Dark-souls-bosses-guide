    <h2 class="sub-title">Description</h2>
    <p class="content">
      Standing almost three times the Chosen Undead's height, the Iron Golem is
      a shell of pure iron powered entirely by its Core. In its left hand it
      carries a large axe that can release a deadly wind projectile. The right
      is used to either smash, or grab and hurl the enemy into the ground. Due
      to its size and weight, the golem has difficulty regaining balance, and
      falling would mean it has somehow been overpowered. Before the battle it
      is dormant, waiting with its weapon held by both hands against its chest,
      where a circular depression symbolizes its initial emptiness.

    <h2 class="sub-title">Strategy</h2>
    <p class="content">
      Killing the firebomb-throwing Giant (located at the very top of the
      fortress, accessible through the stairs opposite the boss' fog wall)
      before initiating the fight with the Iron Golem will eliminate the need to
      deal with the fire area of effect, and is strongly recommended. When first
      entering through the fog door, the Iron Golem will use its axe to project
      a shockwave. This can be dodged or, if positioned correctly, will hit a
      barrier between the golem and the player. Awareness of one's surroundings
      is key, as it is possible to fall off the edges of the platform. The main
      walkway (extending between the entrance and the golem's starting location)
      is generally safer than the two short walkways on the sides. On diagonally
      opposite sides of the main walkway there are small protected areas, ideal
      places to heal (if necessary) while being protected from the shockwave.
      Sorcerers and other ranged characters can find safe spots where the Iron
      Golem will not use its shockwave attacks at all, and instead use melee
      attacks, all of which will be out of range. If enough attacks are
      concentrated on one of its legs in a short period of time, the Iron Golem
      will lose its balance and eventually fall backward, rendering it
      completely defenseless and unable to attack for some time. When it
      stumbles, it's possible for it to fall off the side of the arena,
      resulting in a very quick victory. Fortunately, the Core of an Iron Golem
      will not be lost. Due to the leg weakness, the way the camera tends to
      swing upward to show the face of the boss, and the risk of falling off the
      platform, target-locking is not recommended. Buffing a Hammer, Club or
      Greathammer with gold pine resin or Sunlight Blade will shred the Iron
      Golem as it is weakest to blunt Strikes and Lightning damage. The
      summonable NPC phantom Black Iron Tarkus is capable of killing the boss
      alone. The golem's attack pattern is slow and predictable. Its most
      damaging attack at close range is its grab, which has ample telegraphing
      and can be either sidestepped or rolled away from. When he performs a foot
      stomp, walk around him and attack the other foot. A simple and efficient
      strategy for melee combat is to roll through the boss (underneath its
      legs) every time it attacks and then strike a few times at its heels.
      Weapons with a wide arc (e.g. halberds) are particularly good for this, as
      they will hit both legs, making it easier to stagger the golem even if one
      of the feet becomes inaccessible due to a stomp. Since all attacks can be
      dodged (or avoided simply by walking), holding the weapon with both hands
      is strongly recommended (not only will it do more damage, but it will also
      make it easier to stagger and knock down the golem). Though it may take a
      while, summoned phantoms may attack and defeat this boss from the bridges
      and pathways on both sides leading to the fog door using bows once the
      battle begins.
