    <h2 class="sub-title">Description</h2>
    <p class="content">
      Ornstein and Smough represent the last ritual challenge for the potential
      Chosen Undead. In fact, the Undead who tried to follow in Gwyn's footsteps
      to sacrifice themselves to the First Flame would have to be tested even
      before obtaining the Lordvessel and seeking powerful souls. Ringing the
      Bells of Awakening represents only the first of these challenges, and
      success means gaining access to Sen's Fortress to be tested further. The
      Undead who manage to overcome the tests and dangers of the fortress and
      defeat the Iron Golem would manage to access Anor Londo. Once they managed
      to enter the cathedral of the city of the gods to try to obtain the
      Lordvessel they would still be challenged by Ornstein and Smough guarding
      it, to ensure that only the strongest of the strongest Undead could have
      an audience with "Gwynevere, Princess of Sunlight.

    <h2 class="sub-title">Strategy</h2>
    <p class="content">
      The player must fight both at the same time. When one is killed, the other
      absorbs some of his power, receiving an HP, damage, and resistance boost,
      and healing back to 100%. He will also take on a physical characteristic
      of his fallen comrade: Ornstein grows in size while Smough is imbued with
      lightning. Having a summoned phantom can make the fight significantly
      easier, as it allows the bosses to be fought separately. Note, however,
      that there's no advantage in damaging both bosses during the first phase
      (as mentioned above, the surviving boss' HP goes back to 100% when the
      second phase begins). The role of the second player is simply to keep one
      of the bosses busy while the other is killed. When fighting alone, one of
      the safest strategies is to kite the bosses around the outside of the
      room, keeping both in view and using the pillars to block their charging
      attacks while whittling them down with hit-and-run tactics. As Ornstein is
      the faster of the pair, he will usually be able to catch up to the player
      quickly. The player can then choose to focus down Ornstein while Smough
      attempts to navigate around the pillars, or double back to Smough after
      getting Ornstein away from him and using the short window of separation to
      attack him before Ornstein returns. Ornstein's moveset consists largely of
      dashing and thrusting attacks, meaning that dodging to his sides is more
      effective than attempting to roll away. He is faster and more nimble
      though, so he can also be harder to hit. As well, he can issue Lightning
      blasts from his spear at range, making him a serious threat at any
      distance. Smough is the tougher of the two, his hammer is capable of
      dealing tremendous damage should it connect. Because the hitbox is
      centered on the head of the hammer, it is best to dodge towards or away
      from him, as getting within the arc of his hammer's horizontal swings can
      cause them to miss entirely. Beware, as he also has a dangerous charge
      attack that he can use if the player is not within striking distance of
      his hammer. Killing Ornstein first is generally regarded as making the
      encounter easier to win, since Smough has more weaknesses and is slower
      than his partner in the second phase. However, killing Smough first will
      yield the Leo Ring, which is a useful ring for certain builds. For melee
      builds, using a weapon with good reach (such as a spear, halberd or a
      sword with a fast thrusting attack) will make it significantly easier to
      hit the bosses when they are near a pillar. Note that both bosses can hit
      through the pillars with some of their attacks. Ranged builds using the
      pillars to control the movement of the bosses should note that not all
      pillars are the same height; some will block projectiles while others will
      not. If Ornstein is defeated first, Smough will gain Lightning attacks
      with his hammer, though his moveset does not change appreciably. He is
      still quite slow and his attacks are still horizontally focused, so
      dodging in and out is still a sound strategy. Be wary of his Banzai Drop
      in this phase, as it creates a Lightning explosion upon impact, dealing
      damage in a large area around him. If Smough is defeated first, Ornstein
      will increase greatly in size, drastically changing his moveset in the
      process. The key to defeating Super Ornstein is to keep in mind that while
      he has absorbed Smough's strengths, he has also inherited his weaknesses:
      Super Ornstein is much slower, and has trouble navigating around pillars.
      Like other large bosses, he also has trouble hitting enemies that are
      directly under him, though his Lightning Banzai Drop helps to counteract
      this. Try to stay extremely close to Super Ornstein and attack his legs,
      dodging out when he performs the Lightning Banzai Drop.
