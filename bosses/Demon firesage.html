    <h2 class="sub-title">Description</h2>
    <p class="content">
      The Demon Firesage wields a Demon's Catalyst, a weapon formed from the
      molten rock of Lost Izalith. The demon itself is similar in appearance to
      the Asylum Demon and the Stray Demon. It has an almost draconic
      appearance, with black scales all over its body and a pair of stubby wings
      on its back. It sports a tail and horn-like growths portrude from its legs
      and arms. Dark red eyes are accompanied by a set of large teeth that are
      revealed by the demon's permanently exposed gums. Additionally, its entire
      body is engulfed in constant flames.
    </p>

    <h2 class="sub-title">Strategy</h2>
    <p class="content">
      The Demon Firesage is very similar in terms of moveset and attacks to the
      Stray Demon, so the same rules apply here: staying behind it and keeping a
      shield up should damage be unavoidable are good ideas. Be wary of its
      overhead attacks that are blockable, but deal heavy stamina damage.
      Getting too far away from it will cause it to either leap at the player
      with its hammer, or do a straight down smash, which can take away a large
      chunk of stamina. Note that both of those attacks do not track, so with
      proper timing, one can easily roll through their smashes. The Demon
      Firesage is highly susceptible to Bleed buildup.
