    <h2 class="sub-title">Description</h2>
    <p class="content">
      Ceaseless Discharge is an imposing creature of monstrous size. He wields
      no weapons, and instead uses his fiery tendrils to fight. His deformed
      face retains a look of pain, as the sores attained at birth swell with
      lava. From his head sprout two horns and seven glowing, red eyes that are
      partially covered by his wrinkled skin. Meanwhile, the right side of his
      body is framed by a "rib cage" made of insect-like appendages. Ten more
      tendrils appear on his back and his left arm coils around his chest, fused
      to his body. His body is the source of the lava that floods the lower
      levels of the Demon Ruins, making the area impassable. Ceaseless Discharge
      can be found on the far end of his arena, watching over the corpse of his
      sister, and must be engaged in battle. Once he is defeated, the lower
      parts of the area will drain of lava, allowing the Chosen Undead to
      explore the remainder of the Demon Ruins.

    <h2 class="sub-title">Strategy</h2>
    <p class="content">
      Upon entering the boss arena, Ceaseless Discharge does not immediately
      attack the player, instead standing vigil over his sister's corpse. The
      player must initiate the fight by attacking Ceaseless Discharge, or by
      looting the Gold-Hemmed Black Set from his sister. If the fight is
      initiated through the former method, Ceaseless Discharge will begin
      fighting the player as normal, and will return to his passive state upon
      player death, requiring the player to attack him to begin the fight again.
      However, if his sister's corpse is pillaged, Ceaseless Discharge will
      become enraged, ripping his arm out of his torso cavity and revealing a
      large lava sore that was previously kept staunched by the arm, and becomes
      permanently hostile for all remaining attempts at fighting the boss.
      Ceaseless Discharge will attack the player using a combination of his
      tendrils and flame projectiles, as well as his left arm should he have
      access to it. His attacks are primarily physical-focused, though if the
      player is out of range he can cast a highly-damaging plume of flame
      instead. Because he stands in the lava field below the cliff, it is
      impossible to directly attack Ceaseless Discharge with melee weapons
      unless he swings at the player first. As he is immune to Fire damage,
      Firebombs cannot hurt him, and the player must instead rely on Bows or
      non-Pyromancy spells in order to damage him. Dodging his physical attacks
      and then counter-attacking by hitting his arm or tendrils also allows
      players without access to ranged combat to damage Ceaseless Discharge.
      Should the player have enraged Ceaseless Discharge and caused him to rip
      his arm out of his torso, it is possible to defeat him with only a few
      attacks. By retreating back to the fog door and crossing over the large
      pit at the start of the arena, the player puts themselves out of reach of
      Ceaseless Discharge's physical attacks. In a move of desperation,
      Ceaseless Discharge will attempt to jump over the pit, but fall short and
      grab onto the bridge that the player is on. In this state, he is incapable
      of attacking and is fully at the player's mercy. Attacking his arm at this
      point will cause him to lose his grip and fall into the pit, ending the
      battle. However, if Ceaseless Discharge's left arm is still fused to his
      torso, he will instead perform ranged fire attacks to damage the player,
      which are very difficult to dodge on the narrow bridge path.
